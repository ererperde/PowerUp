If you are looking for a library that offers immersive ensemble recordings and intense cinematic orchestral effects, you might want to check out Project SAM - Symphobia. This library is not your traditional orchestral sample library. Instead of focusing on individual instruments, Symphobia offers ensemble multi-samples in numerous arrangements and across different orchestral sections. The reason is simple: the real thing sounds so much better.
