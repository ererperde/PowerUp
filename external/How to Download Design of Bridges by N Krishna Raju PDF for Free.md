 Here is what I came up with:  
If you are wondering why you should read Design of Bridges by N. Krishna Raju, here are some reasons. First, the book covers a wide range of topics related to bridge engineering, such as types of bridges, loads and forces, structural analysis, design criteria, materials, foundations, superstructures, substructures, bearings and joints, prestressed concrete bridges, steel bridges, composite bridges, cable-stayed bridges, suspension bridges, arch bridges, movable bridges, and aesthetic considerations. Second, the book provides numerous examples, illustrations, tables, charts, and diagrams to explain the concepts and methods clearly and concisely. Third, the book includes several case studies of real-life bridges from different countries and regions to demonstrate the practical applications and challenges of bridge design.
 
However, Design of Bridges by N. Krishna Raju also has some limitations that you should be aware of. First, the book was published in 2005 and may not reflect the latest developments and innovations in bridge engineering. Second, the book is mainly focused on the Indian context and may not cover some aspects of bridge design that are relevant to other countries and regions.
